### Key Architectural Decisions

#### 1. **Server + Client Components**

- Server components for SEO and performance
- Client components for interactivity
- Suspense boundaries for streaming

#### 2. **Zustand with Immer**

- Centralized state management
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Persistence in localStorage

#### 3. **shadcn/ui Design System**

- Consistent design
- Accessibility out of the box
- Customization through CSS variables

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Responsive Design

- **Mobile-first** approach
- Flexible layouts for all screens
